Based on the "Dubai German Car Workshop Marketing Research" report 1 and the context of your "Video-Centric Storytelling" and "Interactive Lead Magnet" strategies, here is a 90-day campaign plan.

Note: The research report explicitly identifies "Maintenance Cost Calculators" as a key interactive lead magnet. This plan treats your "Workflow Audit Tool" as a similar high-value utility to capture leads, replacing the friction of traditional contact forms.
Campaign Objective
Drive qualified leads for the German Car Workshop by using YouTube content to build "technical proof" and the Workflow Audit Tool as the primary conversion mechanism.
Phase 1: Foundation & Content Alignment (Days 1–30)
Focus: Aligning YouTube content with "Aspirant Expert" positioning and integrating the Audit Tool.
Content Strategy: Pivot YouTube content to "Video-Centric Storytelling" that emphasizes transparency and technical expertise2.


Action: Produce "diagnostic tour" and "engine overhaul" videos3. These serve as "technical proof" to build trust with car owners who identify as "aspirant experts"4.


Workflow Audit Integration: Place the Workflow Audit Tool (or Maintenance Calculator) link prominently in the first 3 lines of every video description and as a pinned comment. Position it as a way to "Check Your Car’s Health Score" or "Calculate Upcoming Maintenance Costs."
Avoid Failed Strategy: Stop relying on generic "Book Now" buttons or static contact forms, as the report highlights these create friction. Instead, use the tool to initiate "Conversational Commerce" via WhatsApp5.


Phase 2: Targeted Distribution & Segment Validation (Days 31–60)
Focus: Reaching validated segments using first-party data.
Targeting: Utilize "First-Party Data Strategies" by uploading your existing customer database to create "Lookalike Audiences" on YouTube (Google Ads)6.


Segment: Target owners of specific EV models (Porsche Taycan, Audi e-tron) with content focused on "Battery Health Reports" and charging infrastructure, as identified in the report's EV transition trends7.


Campaign Tactics:
Short-Form Video: Distribute cuts of the technical deep-dives as YouTube Shorts (and Reels) to drive traffic to the main channel and the Audit Tool8.


Hyper-Local Focus: Bid on high-intent phrases like "Mercedes engine repair Al Quoz" to capture immediate demand9.


Phase 3: Optimization & Conversational Conversion (Days 61–90)
Focus: Converting Audit Tool users into appointments.
Lead Nurture: Integrate the Workflow Audit Tool with the WhatsApp Business API10.


Flow: When a user completes an audit, automatically send the report via WhatsApp and start a conversation (e.g., "Your Audi needs a Service A. Would you like a quote?"). This aligns with the "Conversational Commerce" strategy to increase lead-to-appointment conversions11.


Proactive Retention: Use the data collected from the Audit Tool (e.g., mileage, vehicle age) to trigger proactive service alerts, moving from "reactive repairs to proactive partners"12.


Review: Analyze drop-off rates in the Audit Tool and refine the questions to ensure they are answering "conversational" queries optimized for Generative Search13.
